# My experience:
The Google Cybersecurity Certificate was instrumental in building my technical foundation across Linux, SQL, and Python. I found the hands-on labs especially effective for translating security theory into practical incident response skills. This program has equipped me with the confidence to navigate complex security frameworks, and I am now focused on pursuing advanced training to transition into a professional cybersecurity role. Upon completing this course, I discovered my passion for Blue Team operations. I am drawn to the defensive nature of a SOC analyst role, where I can monitor and detect threats while triaging critical information in real time.
